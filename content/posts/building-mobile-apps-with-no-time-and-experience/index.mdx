## Things I've talked about:

- Scenario in which we have 2 months to build our app üò¨
- 4 options for building our app. 2 "useless" options (looking at the fact that we have 2 months to build it): Native or Compiled app and 2 "useful" options: Hybrid app or PWA. More info on every of them.
- Hybrid looks like the best option for our scenario.
- More on Capacitor and Ionic - technologies we can use.
- Setting up our app and looking into the code.
- The rest is classic web app creation with a bit of help...
- Then we do the deployment and app release üöÄ
- This is how we get our app (hopefully on deadline).
- Couple of FYIs (adding Capacitor to existing project easily, omitting app's review while updating our app, and easily making PWA from our Hybrid app).

- Small contest and Q&A ü•≥

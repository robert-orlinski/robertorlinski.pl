I blog from time to time (currently only in Polish). I also like TypeScript, React and Next.js.

So what can come from the combination of those 2? Blog page written in TypeScript, React and Next.js! Also with content written as MDX files, nice features like quick search, [Giscus comments](https://github.com/giscus/giscus), code highlighting based on [rehype-prism](https://github.com/mapbox/rehype-prism) in articles, autogenerated RSS feed, search results cache, and some other stuff.

You can find it live at [robertorlinski.pl](https://robertorlinski.pl/) and see more!

## How can you run it in your local environment?

> Right now, I am using node@17.9.0.

Copy the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/robert-orlinski/robertorlinski.pl.git
cd the-path-to-which-you-cloned-the-project
```

Run the app:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

If you want to build the project, you can use:

```
npm run build
```

And if you want to start the built project, you can use:

```
npm run start
```

## Used technologies:

1. React.js (the main project framework);
2. Next.js (React framework with server side rendering, static pages generating and back-end building capabilities);
3. TypeScript (language which makes JavaScript type safe);
4. Styled Components (CSS in JS tool);
5. MDX Bundler (tool for markdown files in which we can also include React components);
6. TS-Node (to have TypeScript also in Node.js files);
7. Jest and React Testing Library (for unit and React components testing);
8. React Hook Form (nice and fast forms).

Additionally, I am using some smaller and bigger tools: ESLint, Prettier, Day.js, rss, polish-plurals, rehype-prism, and reading-time.

## What I want to implement next?

1. Dark mode!
2. Share buttons in single articles.
3. Newsletter archive.

And that's it for now. Maybe you have some ideas for new features or content you would like to see on this blog? If yes, you can always propose them in the [issues](https://github.com/robert-orlinski/robertorlinski.pl/issues) tab!
